Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX report studio Korean UI localization slice
Agent: codex
Status: completed
Summary: RedTeam AX Report Studio RedTeam2 Korean UX slice localized sanitizer, visual evidence, file upload, RBAC/report metadata, ToolActionCard queue, and guardrail/evidence gate labels. Added live browser smoke checks for sanitizerGuidance, visualEvidenceGuidance, fileUploadGuidance, and rbacReportMetadataGuidance. Verified frontend build, API regression, sample E2E, plan contract, and live browser smoke.
Next action: Next slice should add Korean display mapping helper for remaining internal status/severity/role strings in Agentic RAG and ToolActionCard areas.
Artifacts:
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-browser-smoke/latest_live_browser_parser_smoke.json
Commands:
- node --check reports.js :: exit_code=0
- python -m py_compile redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py :: exit_code=0
- python test_plan_contract.py :: exit_code=0
- npm.cmd run build :: exit_code=0
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py :: exit_code=0
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py :: exit_code=0
- python redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --require-live --timeout 90 :: exit_code=0
Risks:
- Some API status values, role IDs, severity IDs, and product terms remain English by design or pending display mapping helper.

Completion definition: the session can close when the recorded artifacts, command evidence, decisions, risks, and handoff are sufficient for a future agent to resume without chat memory.
