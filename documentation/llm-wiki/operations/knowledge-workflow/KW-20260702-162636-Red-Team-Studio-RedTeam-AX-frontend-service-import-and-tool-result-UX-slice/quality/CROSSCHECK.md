Autofill timestamp: 2026-07-02T16:35:28+09:00
Project: Red Team Studio
Task: RedTeam AX frontend service import and tool result UX slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam2 frontend now has a Korean read-only OpenVAS/ZAP service report import panel wired to /api/redteam/v2/scanner-service-imports/{tool_id}; added frontend contract sanity, updated Korean copy inventory, accepted gate manifest, plans, LLM wiki, and completion audit.
Next action: When Docker daemon and organization scanner services are ready, run container runtime smoke and real external service import smoke.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_frontend_service_import_contract.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
Commands:
- python J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py -> passed 13/13
Risks:
- Overall goal remains active_incomplete: Docker/container runtime live smoke and organization OpenVAS/ZAP service endpoint evidence remain environment-dependent.

Contradictions found: none recorded by autofill. If later review finds a contradiction, append it here before closing again.
