# Trust Assessment

## Claims

## Overclaim Check

## Hallucination Check

## Bias Check

## Required Follow-Up


## Autofill Quality Evidence

Claim under assessment: Slice 41 added an opt-in live browser approval queue smoke for RedTeam AX v2. The harness now supports --allow-approval-request, which requires --allow-action, clicks ToolActionCard planning, clicks Request Approval, records the /api/redteam/v2/tool-actions/{action_id}/request-approval response, verifies ApprovalRequested queue state, verifies required approver roles, and confirms Execute Governed Runner remains visible but disabled before approval. It does not grant approval or execute the governed runner.

Confidence: evidence-backed for the listed artifacts and commands.
Uncertainty: any remaining risk listed below still requires follow-up.
Review needed: yes if the project-specific final gate is not clean.

Task: Implement RedTeam AX v2 live approval queue browser smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: Slice 41 added an opt-in live browser approval queue smoke for RedTeam AX v2. The harness now supports --allow-approval-request, which requires --allow-action, clicks ToolActionCard planning, clicks Request Approval, records the /api/redteam/v2/tool-actions/{action_id}/request-approval response, verifies ApprovalRequested queue state, verifies required approver roles, and confirms Execute Governed Runner remains visible but disabled before approval. It does not grant approval or execute the governed runner.
Next action: Continue from the recorded handoff and latest evidence.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-browser-smoke/latest_live_browser_parser_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
Commands:
- python -m py_compile Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py -> exit 0
- redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --allow-action --allow-approval-request --require-live -> exit 0, status passed, blockers []
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py -> 42 tests OK
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py -> 1 test OK
- npm.cmd run build in frontend/report-studio-vite -> vite build OK
- python Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py -> plan contract sanity passed
Risks:
- Next slice still needs approval grant smoke and manual-run-only evidence upload requirement verification; full goal remains incomplete.
