# Knowledge Synthesis

## Ideation

Possible directions, options, and candidate approaches.

## Brainstorming

Expanded possibilities, edge cases, missing items, and combinations.

## Inspiration

Patterns, analogies, tools, examples, and transferable ideas found during work.

## Insights

Evidence-backed understanding that should change future work.

## Code And Artifact Trace

| target | checked | finding | follow_up |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## Reuse Candidates

Items that should become ADR, checklist, template, script, refactor, or future task.


## Autofill Knowledge Synthesis

Reusable pattern: sidecar evidence drafting.

The implementation agent should continue doing product work while a short autofill command converts the final summary, artifacts, commands, decisions, and risks into the required Knowledge Workflow files.

Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: Implement RedTeam AX v2 live approval queue browser smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: Slice 41 added an opt-in live browser approval queue smoke for RedTeam AX v2. The harness now supports --allow-approval-request, which requires --allow-action, clicks ToolActionCard planning, clicks Request Approval, records the /api/redteam/v2/tool-actions/{action_id}/request-approval response, verifies ApprovalRequested queue state, verifies required approver roles, and confirms Execute Governed Runner remains visible but disabled before approval. It does not grant approval or execute the governed runner.
Next action: Continue from the recorded handoff and latest evidence.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-browser-smoke/latest_live_browser_parser_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
Commands:
- python -m py_compile Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py -> exit 0
- redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --allow-action --allow-approval-request --require-live -> exit 0, status passed, blockers []
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py -> 42 tests OK
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py -> 1 test OK
- npm.cmd run build in frontend/report-studio-vite -> vite build OK
- python Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py -> plan contract sanity passed
Risks:
- Next slice still needs approval grant smoke and manual-run-only evidence upload requirement verification; full goal remains incomplete.

Reuse candidate: assign this command to a lightweight `kw-sidecar` agent or launch it through `Start-Process` after the final validation command has produced artifacts.
