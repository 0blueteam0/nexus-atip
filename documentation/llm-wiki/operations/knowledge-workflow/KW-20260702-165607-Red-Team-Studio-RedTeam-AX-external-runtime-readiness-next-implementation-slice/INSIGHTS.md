## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: RedTeam AX external runtime readiness next implementation slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: Added RedTeam AX external OpenVAS/ZAP service import live harness, connected its artifact to /api/redteam/v2/runtime-readiness and RedTeam2 runtime readiness UI, updated accepted gate manifest to 16/16, and refreshed plan/wiki/audit evidence.
Next action: When organization endpoint/vault envs and Docker daemon are available, run external scanner readiness/import with --allow-network --require-ready and container runtime smoke with --allow-real --require-real.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_external_scanner_service_import_live_smoke.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-external-scanner-service-import-live/latest_external_scanner_service_import_live_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/runtime/redteam_v2_models.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js
Commands:
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py -> exit_code 0, accepted_gate_count 16, passed_gate_count 16, failed_gate_count 0
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_external_scanner_service_import_live_smoke.py -> exit_code 0, status blocked_external_scanner_import_not_ready, service_endpoint_fetch_executed false
Risks:
- Goal remains active: Docker daemon real container smoke and organization OpenVAS/ZAP endpoint/vault env live import are still not proved in this environment.
