## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: RedTeam AX real installed tool live smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX installed npm live smoke slice executed npm.cmd --version through governed ToolActionCard, ExecutionPlan, token, wrapper pin, allowlist, shell=false runner, sanitizer, agent normalization, and Evidence Card creation.
Next action: Implement OpenVAS/ZAP credential vault contract or run additional installed scanner live smokes when approved tools are available.

Commands:

- pytest tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py -q => exit 0, 1 passed

- test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
- test_redteam2_korean_copy_inventory.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Remaining runtime coverage is limited to npm.cmd on this host; additional scanner CLIs and Docker/container runtime need separate live smoke artifacts before full completion.
