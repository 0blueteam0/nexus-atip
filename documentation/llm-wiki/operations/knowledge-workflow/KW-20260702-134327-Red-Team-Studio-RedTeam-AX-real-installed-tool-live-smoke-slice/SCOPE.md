## Required Artifacts

| artifact | path | purpose |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## Verification Criteria

| criterion | evidence_required |
|---|---|
| Scope declared | `SCOPE.md` |
| Evidence recorded | `EVIDENCE_UNITS.md` |

## Completion Definition

The task is complete only when scope, artifacts, evidence, decisions, handoff, and gate result exist.


## Autofill Scope

The session covers the work described in the summary below and keeps execution metadata inside this Knowledge Workflow session.

Autofill timestamp: 2026-07-02T13:48:28+09:00
Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX real installed tool live smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX installed npm live smoke slice executed npm.cmd --version through governed ToolActionCard, ExecutionPlan, token, wrapper pin, allowlist, shell=false runner, sanitizer, agent normalization, and Evidence Card creation.
Next action: Implement OpenVAS/ZAP credential vault contract or run additional installed scanner live smokes when approved tools are available.

Commands:
- pytest tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py -q => exit 0, 49 passed
- pytest tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py -q => exit 0, 1 passed
- redteam_ax_installed_tool_live_smoke.py => exit 0, status passed
- py_compile redteam_v2_models.py redteam_v2_api_router.py redteam_ax_installed_tool_live_smoke.py => exit 0
- test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
- test_redteam2_korean_copy_inventory.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Remaining runtime coverage is limited to npm.cmd on this host; additional scanner CLIs and Docker/container runtime need separate live smoke artifacts before full completion.

Completion definition: the session can close when the recorded artifacts, command evidence, decisions, risks, and handoff are sufficient for a future agent to resume without chat memory.
