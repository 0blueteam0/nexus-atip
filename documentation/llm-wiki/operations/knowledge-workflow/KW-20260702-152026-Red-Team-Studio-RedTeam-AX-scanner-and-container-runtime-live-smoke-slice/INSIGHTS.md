## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: RedTeam AX scanner and container runtime live smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX scanner CLI live smoke slice: installed checksum-verified portable official Nuclei v3.10.0 and Trivy v0.72.0 under tools/redteam-ax, ran both through ToolActionCard, ExecutionPlan, wrapper pin, execution token, shell=false governed runner, sanitizer, agent normalization, and Evidence Card creation; accepted gate manifest now passes 10/10. OpenVAS/ZAP CLI or service and Docker daemon remain runtime blockers.
Next action: Provide or start OpenVAS/ZAP service endpoints and restore Docker Desktop daemon, then run remaining live smokes.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_scanner_cli_live_smoke.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-scanner-cli-live-smoke/latest_scanner_cli_live_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-runtime-smoke/latest_container_runtime_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
Commands:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_scanner_cli_live_smoke.py => exit 0, Nuclei/Trivy passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py --require-real => exit 1, Docker daemon unavailable blocker artifact
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 10/10 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Large portable binaries are installed locally but should not be committed to GitHub; the smoke script re-downloads and verifies them from official release checksums.
