Claim: RedTeam AX scanner CLI live smoke slice: installed checksum-verified portable official Nuclei v3.10.0 and Trivy v0.72.0 under tools/redteam-ax, ran both through ToolActionCard, ExecutionPlan, wrapper pin, execution token, shell=false governed runner, sanitizer, agent normalization, and Evidence Card creation; accepted gate manifest now passes 10/10. OpenVAS/ZAP CLI or service and Docker daemon remain runtime blockers.

- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-scanner-cli-live-smoke/latest_scanner_cli_live_smoke.json

Command evidence:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_scanner_cli_live_smoke.py => exit 0, Nuclei/Trivy passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py --require-real => exit 1, Docker daemon unavailable blocker artifact
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 10/10 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0

Limits:
- Large portable binaries are installed locally but should not be committed to GitHub; the smoke script re-downloads and verifies them from official release checksums.
