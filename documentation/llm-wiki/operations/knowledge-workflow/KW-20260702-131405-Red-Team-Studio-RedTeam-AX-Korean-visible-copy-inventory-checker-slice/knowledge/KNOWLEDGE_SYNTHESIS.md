# Knowledge Synthesis

## Ideation

Possible directions, options, and candidate approaches.

## Brainstorming

Expanded possibilities, edge cases, missing items, and combinations.

## Inspiration

Patterns, analogies, tools, examples, and transferable ideas found during work.

## Insights

Evidence-backed understanding that should change future work.

## Code And Artifact Trace

| target | checked | finding | follow_up |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## Reuse Candidates

Items that should become ADR, checklist, template, script, refactor, or future task.


## Autofill Knowledge Synthesis

Reusable pattern: sidecar evidence drafting.

The implementation agent should continue doing product work while a short autofill command converts the final summary, artifacts, commands, decisions, and risks into the required Knowledge Workflow files.

Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX Korean visible copy inventory checker slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX Korean visible-copy inventory checker slice: added sanity checker for RedTeam2 visible copy, generated inventory artifact, updated completion audit RTA-COMP-002 from partial to proved, and removed visible-copy audit from remaining gaps.
Next action: Implement MCP direct invoke deny smoke or scanner install/version evidence capture.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_redteam2_korean_copy_inventory.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam2_korean_copy_inventory.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam_ax_completion_audit_matrix.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/REDTEAM_AX_COMPLETION_AUDIT_MATRIX.md
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/llm-wiki/LLM_WIKI_HOME.md
Commands:
- python J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_redteam2_korean_copy_inventory.py => exit 0, 730/873 Korean-context literals, English-only ratio 0.1592
- python J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- python J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
- python -m py_compile J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_redteam2_korean_copy_inventory.py => exit 0
Risks:
- The checker is static and scoped to RedTeam2 panel/tab literals; future dynamic API-provided copy still needs separate coverage if exposed as user-facing UI.

Reuse candidate: assign this command to a lightweight `kw-sidecar` agent or launch it through `Start-Process` after the final validation command has produced artifacts.
