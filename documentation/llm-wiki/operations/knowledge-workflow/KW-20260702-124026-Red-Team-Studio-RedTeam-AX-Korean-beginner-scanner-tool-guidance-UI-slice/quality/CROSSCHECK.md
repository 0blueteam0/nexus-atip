Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX Korean beginner scanner tool guidance UI slice
Agent: codex
Status: completed
Summary: RedTeam AX Report Studio RedTeam2 now shows Korean beginner scanner tool guidance for Nuclei, OpenVAS, Trivy, SCA, npm audit, and OWASP ZAP, including approval, safe mode, prohibited options, and Evidence linking guidance.
Next action: Korean-localize remaining wrapper/execution-plan/runner labels and add beginner-friendly runbook wording.
Artifacts:
- soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js
- Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
- archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-browser-smoke/latest_live_browser_parser_smoke.json
Commands:
- node --check reports.js exit 0
- py_compile redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py exit 0
- test_plan_contract.py exit 0
- npm.cmd run build exit 0
- tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py exit 0, 46 tests
- tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py exit 0
- redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --require-live exit 0
Risks:
- Remaining UI areas still contain English labels in wrapper, execution plan, runner, sanitizer, and upload sections; next slice should continue Korean localization.

Contradictions found: none recorded by autofill. If later review finds a contradiction, append it here before closing again.
