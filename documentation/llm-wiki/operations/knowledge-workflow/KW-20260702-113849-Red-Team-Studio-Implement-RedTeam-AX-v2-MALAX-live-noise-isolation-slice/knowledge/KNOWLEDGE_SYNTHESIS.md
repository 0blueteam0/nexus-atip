# Knowledge Synthesis

## Ideation

Possible directions, options, and candidate approaches.

## Brainstorming

Expanded possibilities, edge cases, missing items, and combinations.

## Inspiration

Patterns, analogies, tools, examples, and transferable ideas found during work.

## Insights

Evidence-backed understanding that should change future work.

## Code And Artifact Trace

| target | checked | finding | follow_up |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## Reuse Candidates

Items that should become ADR, checklist, template, script, refactor, or future task.


## Autofill Knowledge Synthesis

Reusable pattern: sidecar evidence drafting.

The implementation agent should continue doing product work while a short autofill command converts the final summary, artifacts, commands, decisions, and risks into the required Knowledge Workflow files.

Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: Implement RedTeam AX v2 MALAX live noise isolation slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: Slice 40 isolated MALAX live polling noise that affected Report Studio and RedTeam2 browser smoke. The MALAX bridge now catches core RecordStore failures for /api/malax/latest and /api/malax/runs, returns a degraded latest payload or legacy run fallback instead of HTTP 500, and the RedTeam AX live browser smoke now waits for domcontentloaded/body visibility instead of networkidle so ongoing MALAX polling does not block DOM verification.
Next action: Continue from the recorded handoff and latest evidence.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/runtime/malware_upload_api.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/tests/test_malax_bridge_degraded.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-browser-smoke/latest_live_browser_parser_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
Commands:
- python tests/test_malax_bridge_degraded.py -> 2 tests OK
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py -> 42 tests OK
- python -m py_compile runtime/malware_upload_api.py redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py -> exit 0
- Invoke-RestMethod /api/malax/latest and /api/malax/runs?limit=8 against live 8765 -> both HTTP 200
- redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --allow-action --require-live -> status passed, blockers []
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py -> 1 test OK
- npm.cmd run build in frontend/report-studio-vite -> vite build OK
- python Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py -> plan contract sanity passed
Risks:
- Underlying MALAX workspace/storage disk I/O root cause is not fixed; it is isolated from UI polling and remains tracked separately in FINAL_PLAN.

Reuse candidate: assign this command to a lightweight `kw-sidecar` agent or launch it through `Start-Process` after the final validation command has produced artifacts.
