## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: Implement RedTeam AX v2 Nuclei ZAP OpenVAS container stdout parser smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: pass
Summary: Implemented RedTeam AX v2 slice 34 parser smoke coverage for governed container stdout fixtures. API tests now create dry-run ephemeral-container tool runs for Nuclei, ZAP, and OpenVAS, feed untrusted container_mock_stdout artifacts, run agent-analyze, verify parser labels container_launch_plan+nuclei_jsonl, container_launch_plan+zap_json, and container_launch_plan+openvas_xml, assert both container_launch_evidence and scanner_finding_candidate structured items, and create Evidence Card candidates for each scanner. FINAL_PLAN records slice 34 completed dry-run parser smoke and leaves real Docker/Podman runtime stdout/stderr plus live browser smoke pending.
Next action: Generate cross-LLM handoff, stage only slice 34 files, commit, and push origin main.
Artifacts:
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
Commands:
- python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_redteam_v2_api_router.py => exit_code 0, Ran 42 tests OK
- python -m unittest tests.test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e => exit_code 0, Ran 1 test OK
- node --check projects/ai-agentic-soc/soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js => exit_code 0
- npm.cmd run build => exit_code 0, Vite build succeeded with existing large chunk warning
- python projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit_code 0, plan contract sanity passed
Risks:
- Real Docker/Podman runtime stdout/stderr smoke remains pending; dry-run fixtures prove parser wiring but not host runtime execution.
- Nuclei combined parser may still see container launch JSON as a weak candidate, so tests select the scanner_finding_candidate with the expected template_id.
