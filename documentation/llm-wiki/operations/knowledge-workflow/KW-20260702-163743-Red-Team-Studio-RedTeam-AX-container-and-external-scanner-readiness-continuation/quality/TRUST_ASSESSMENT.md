## Required Follow-Up


## Autofill Quality Evidence

Claim under assessment: Added RedTeam AX external OpenVAS/ZAP read-only service readiness checker, refreshed Docker real container blocker artifact, updated accepted gate manifest to 14 gates, and recorded remaining environment-dependent completion gaps in plans/wiki/audit.

Confidence: evidence-backed for the listed artifacts and commands.
Uncertainty: any remaining risk listed below still requires follow-up.
Review needed: yes if the project-specific final gate is not clean.

Task: RedTeam AX container and external scanner readiness continuation
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: Added RedTeam AX external OpenVAS/ZAP read-only service readiness checker, refreshed Docker real container blocker artifact, updated accepted gate manifest to 14 gates, and recorded remaining environment-dependent completion gaps in plans/wiki/audit.
Next action: After environment readiness, run container smoke with --allow-real --require-real and external scanner readiness with --allow-network --require-ready.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_external_scanner_service_readiness.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-external-scanner-readiness/latest_external_scanner_service_readiness.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-runtime-smoke/latest_container_runtime_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
Commands:
- docker version --format {{json .}} -> Server null, Docker Desktop unable to start
- python 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py --allow-real --require-real -> blocked_container_runtime_not_ready
- python 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_external_scanner_service_readiness.py -> blocked_external_scanner_services_not_ready
- python 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py -> passed 14/14
Risks:
- Docker daemon remains unavailable; external OpenVAS/ZAP endpoint and vault reference environment variables are not configured.
