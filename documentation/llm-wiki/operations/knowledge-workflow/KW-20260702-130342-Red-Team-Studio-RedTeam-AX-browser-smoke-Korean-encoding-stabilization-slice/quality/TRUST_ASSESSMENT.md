## Autofill Quality Evidence

Claim under assessment: RedTeam AX live browser smoke Korean encoding slice fixed Node probe stdout decoding by setting subprocess encoding=utf-8. Added stdout_decoded_as_utf8 regression gate so smoke fails if Korean Report Studio / RedTeam2 text is not preserved in Python-decoded stdout. Regenerated smoke artifact and verified bodyPrefix contains Korean text by unicode_escape/codepoint checks.

Confidence: evidence-backed for the listed artifacts and commands.
Uncertainty: any remaining risk listed below still requires follow-up.
Review needed: yes if the project-specific final gate is not clean.

Status: completed
Summary: RedTeam AX live browser smoke Korean encoding slice fixed Node probe stdout decoding by setting subprocess encoding=utf-8. Added stdout_decoded_as_utf8 regression gate so smoke fails if Korean Report Studio / RedTeam2 text is not preserved in Python-decoded stdout. Regenerated smoke artifact and verified bodyPrefix contains Korean text by unicode_escape/codepoint checks.
Next action: Next slice should build a requirement-by-requirement completion audit matrix for the full RedTeam AX objective and select remaining functional gaps.
Artifacts:
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-browser-smoke/latest_live_browser_parser_smoke.json
Commands:
- python -m py_compile redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py :: exit_code=0
- python test_plan_contract.py :: exit_code=0
- npm.cmd run build :: exit_code=0
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py :: exit_code=0
- python tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py :: exit_code=0
- python redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --require-live --timeout 90 :: exit_code=0
- python artifact unicode_escape Korean bodyPrefix check :: exit_code=0
Risks:
- PowerShell terminal output can still display Korean mojibake depending on console encoding, but the JSON artifact bytes and Python UTF-8 readback are correct.
