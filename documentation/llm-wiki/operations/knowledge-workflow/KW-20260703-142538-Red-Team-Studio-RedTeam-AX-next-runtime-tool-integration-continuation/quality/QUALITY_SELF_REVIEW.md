# Quality Self Review

- No broad refactor introduced.
- Existing API behavior remains compatible when `toolchain_id` is omitted.
- The new projection uses existing `toolchain-runs` storage rather than a separate state model.
- Test covers service import, run-status, and collect-results.
- Documentation clearly states that this is not final goal completion.
