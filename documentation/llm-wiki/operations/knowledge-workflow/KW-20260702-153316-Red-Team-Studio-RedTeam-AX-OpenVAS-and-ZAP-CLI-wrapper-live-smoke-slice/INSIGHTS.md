## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: RedTeam AX OpenVAS and ZAP CLI wrapper live smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX OpenVAS/ZAP CLI wrapper live smoke slice: isolated gvm-tools and zapcli in tools/redteam-ax venv, generated hash-pinned .cmd shims, fixed Windows runner allowlist to accept manifest availability.path case-insensitively, ran OpenVAS gvm-cli and ZAP CLI through ToolActionCard, dry-run ExecutionPlan, execution token, shell=false governed runner, sanitizer, agent normalization, and Evidence Card creation. Accepted gate manifest now passes 11/11. Remaining gaps are Docker/container runtime and actual OpenVAS/ZAP service endpoint import smokes.
Next action: Restore Docker daemon or provide OpenVAS/ZAP service endpoints, then add service/container live smokes.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_openvas_zap_cli_live_smoke.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-openvas-zap-cli-live-smoke/latest_openvas_zap_cli_live_smoke.json

- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
Commands:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_openvas_zap_cli_live_smoke.py => exit 0, OpenVAS/ZAP CLI passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 11/11 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Actual OpenVAS service report import, ZAP daemon passive-alert import, and Docker/container runtime remain unproven.
