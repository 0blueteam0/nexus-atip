## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX completion audit matrix slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX completion audit matrix slice: added machine-checkable requirement evidence matrix, Markdown wiki note, FINAL_PLAN Slice 53, LLM wiki link, and sanity validator while keeping full goal active_incomplete.
Next action: Implement RedTeam2 visible-copy Korean beginner UX inventory checker or MCP direct invoke deny smoke.

Risks:
- Full goal remains incomplete: install/version evidence, OpenVAS/ZAP vault policy, full gate manifest, MCP deny smoke, and real container runtime proof are not yet fully proven.
