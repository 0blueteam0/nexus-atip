Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX completion audit matrix slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX completion audit matrix slice: added machine-checkable requirement evidence matrix, Markdown wiki note, FINAL_PLAN Slice 53, LLM wiki link, and sanity validator while keeping full goal active_incomplete.
Next action: Implement RedTeam2 visible-copy Korean beginner UX inventory checker or MCP direct invoke deny smoke.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam_ax_completion_audit_matrix.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/REDTEAM_AX_COMPLETION_AUDIT_MATRIX.md
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py

Commands:
- python J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- python J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
- python -m py_compile J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py => exit 0, 1 passed
Risks:
- Full goal remains incomplete: install/version evidence, OpenVAS/ZAP vault policy, full gate manifest, MCP deny smoke, and real container runtime proof are not yet fully proven.

Completion definition: the session can close when the recorded artifacts, command evidence, decisions, risks, and handoff are sufficient for a future agent to resume without chat memory.
