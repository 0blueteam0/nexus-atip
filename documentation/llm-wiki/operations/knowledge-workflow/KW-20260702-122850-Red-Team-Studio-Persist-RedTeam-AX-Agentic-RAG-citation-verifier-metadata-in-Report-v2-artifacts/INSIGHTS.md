## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: Persist RedTeam AX Agentic RAG citation verifier metadata in Report v2 artifacts slice
Agent: codex
Status: completed
Summary: RedTeam AX Agentic RAG citation verifier metadata persisted into Report v2 validation, markdown report sections, UI payload, live smoke, and hold audit log.
Next action: Translate remaining Report Studio labels and add beginner-friendly scanner tool execution guidance.
Artifacts:
- runtime/redteam_v2_models.py
- tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py
- soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js
- Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py
- Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
Commands:
- py_compile exit 0
- tests/test_redteam_v2_api_router.py exit 0, 46 tests
- tests/test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py exit 0
- test_plan_contract.py exit 0
- npm.cmd run build exit 0
- redteam_ax_live_browser_parser_smoke.py --allow-browser --allow-agentic-rag --require-live exit 0
Risks:
- Full-screen Korean localization remains for next slice; current slice localizes touched Agentic RAG/report gate surfaces.
