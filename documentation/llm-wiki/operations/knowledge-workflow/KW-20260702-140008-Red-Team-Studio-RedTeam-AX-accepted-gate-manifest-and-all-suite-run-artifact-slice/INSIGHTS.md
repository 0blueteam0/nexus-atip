## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Task: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest and all-suite run artifact slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest slice: added a machine-checkable harness, generated latest accepted gate manifest with 9/9 gates passing, updated completion audit RTA-COMP-012 to proved, and left scanner/container live smoke as the only remaining completion gap.
Next action: Run remaining scanner and container runtime live smokes when the host tools/Docker are available and approved.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam_ax_completion_audit_matrix.json
Commands:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 9/9 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Full thread goal remains active: Nuclei/OpenVAS/Trivy/OWASP ZAP and Docker/container runtime live smokes are still pending.
