|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## Verification Criteria

| criterion | evidence_required |
|---|---|
| Scope declared | `SCOPE.md` |
| Evidence recorded | `EVIDENCE_UNITS.md` |
| Gate closed | `QUALITY_GATE_RESULT.json` |

## Completion Definition

## Autofill Scope

The session covers the work described in the summary below and keeps execution metadata inside this Knowledge Workflow session.

Autofill timestamp: 2026-07-02T15:04:17+09:00
Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest and all-suite run artifact slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest slice: added a machine-checkable harness, generated latest accepted gate manifest with 9/9 gates passing, updated completion audit RTA-COMP-012 to proved, and left scanner/container live smoke as the only remaining completion gap.
Next action: Run remaining scanner and container runtime live smokes when the host tools/Docker are available and approved.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam_ax_completion_audit_matrix.json
Commands:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 9/9 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Full thread goal remains active: Nuclei/OpenVAS/Trivy/OWASP ZAP and Docker/container runtime live smokes are still pending.

Completion definition: the session can close when the recorded artifacts, command evidence, decisions, risks, and handoff are sufficient for a future agent to resume without chat memory.
