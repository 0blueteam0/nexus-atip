# Knowledge Synthesis

## Ideation

Possible directions, options, and candidate approaches.

## Brainstorming

Expanded possibilities, edge cases, missing items, and combinations.

## Inspiration

Patterns, analogies, tools, examples, and transferable ideas found during work.

## Insights

Evidence-backed understanding that should change future work.

## Code And Artifact Trace

| target | checked | finding | follow_up |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |

## Reuse Candidates

Items that should become ADR, checklist, template, script, refactor, or future task.


## Autofill Knowledge Synthesis

Reusable pattern: sidecar evidence drafting.

The implementation agent should continue doing product work while a short autofill command converts the final summary, artifacts, commands, decisions, and risks into the required Knowledge Workflow files.

Autofill timestamp: 2026-07-02T15:04:17+09:00
Project: Red-Team-Studio
Task: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest and all-suite run artifact slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest slice: added a machine-checkable harness, generated latest accepted gate manifest with 9/9 gates passing, updated completion audit RTA-COMP-012 to proved, and left scanner/container live smoke as the only remaining completion gap.
Next action: Run remaining scanner and container runtime live smokes when the host tools/Docker are available and approved.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam_ax_completion_audit_matrix.json
Commands:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 9/9 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0
Risks:
- Full thread goal remains active: Nuclei/OpenVAS/Trivy/OWASP ZAP and Docker/container runtime live smokes are still pending.

Reuse candidate: assign this command to a lightweight `kw-sidecar` agent or launch it through `Start-Process` after the final validation command has produced artifacts.
