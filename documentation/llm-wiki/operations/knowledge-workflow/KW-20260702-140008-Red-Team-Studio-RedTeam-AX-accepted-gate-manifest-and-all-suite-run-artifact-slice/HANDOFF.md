Current state: RedTeam AX accepted gate manifest slice: added a machine-checkable harness, generated latest accepted gate manifest with 9/9 gates passing, updated completion audit RTA-COMP-012 to proved, and left scanner/container live smoke as the only remaining completion gap.

Next action: Run remaining scanner and container runtime live smokes when the host tools/Docker are available and approved.

Required artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/completion-audit/redteam_ax_completion_audit_matrix.json

Required command evidence:
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py => exit 0, 9/9 gates passed
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_completion_audit_matrix.py => exit 0
- ../.venv/Scripts/python.exe 고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit 0

Remaining risks:
- Full thread goal remains active: Nuclei/OpenVAS/Trivy/OWASP ZAP and Docker/container runtime live smokes are still pending.

Future agent rule: start from this session directory and the project-specific source-of-truth ledgers before using chat history.
