## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Project: Red Team Studio
Task: RedTeam AX Docker container runtime live smoke slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: Implemented RedTeam AX OpenVAS/ZAP read-only service report import adapter after Docker daemon remained unavailable. Added /api/redteam/v2/scanner-service-imports/{tool_id}, local endpoint smoke, audit/wiki/plan updates, and accepted gate coverage.
Next action: Run real Docker/container runtime smoke after Docker daemon readiness; run organization OpenVAS/ZAP endpoint import smoke when service endpoints are available.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-openvas-zap-service-import-smoke/latest_openvas_zap_service_import_smoke.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_openvas_zap_service_import_smoke.py
Commands:
- python knowledge_workflow.py start exit_code=0
- docker version --format {{json .}} exit_code=1 Docker Server null unable to start
- python redteam_ax_openvas_zap_service_import_smoke.py exit_code=0 status passed
- python redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py exit_code=0 accepted_gate_count 12 passed_gate_count 12
Risks:
- Docker Desktop daemon remains unavailable in current host state.
- Local service import smoke does not prove organization OpenVAS/ZAP endpoint availability.
