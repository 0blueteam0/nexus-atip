## Autofill Tool Decision

Selected tool chain: local repository inspection, scoped edits, command validation, and artifact-backed handoff.

Reason: this path preserves quality while avoiding a manual end-of-turn evidence-writing bottleneck.

Task: Implement RedTeam AX v2 real container runtime smoke harness slice
Agent: codex
Status: pass
Summary: Implemented RedTeam AX v2 slice 36 real container runtime smoke harness. Added Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py as a safe-by-default harness: default mode performs Docker/Podman runtime preflight and writes evidence without executing containers; real execution requires --allow-real or REDTEAM_AX_REAL_CONTAINER_SMOKE=1. The harness records Docker daemon readiness, local image digest availability without pulling, and when opted in uses the FastAPI ephemeral_container runner path to verify stdout/stderr raw artifact capture. Current environment evidence shows Docker CLI is installed but daemon is blocked with Server:null and Docker Desktop is unable to start, so the harness records blocked_container_runtime_not_ready. FINAL_PLAN records slice 36 complete for harness/blocker evidence and keeps daemon-ready --allow-real smoke plus real scanner stdout parser E2E pending.
Next action: Generate cross-LLM handoff, force-stage ignored project harness/evidence files with FINAL_PLAN and session docs, commit, and push origin main.
Artifacts:
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-runtime-smoke/latest_container_runtime_smoke.json
- projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/FINAL_PLAN.md
Commands:
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py => exit_code 0, status blocked_container_runtime_not_ready, blocker docker_daemon_unavailable_or_not_started
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m py_compile Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_container_runtime_smoke.py => exit_code 0
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_redteam_v2_api_router.py => exit_code 0, Ran 42 tests OK
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_redteam_v2_sample_e2e.py => exit_code 0, Ran 1 test OK
- node --check soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js => exit_code 0
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/test_plan_contract.py => exit_code 0, plan contract sanity passed
Risks:
- Current host cannot complete real container stdout/stderr smoke because Docker daemon reports Server:null and Docker Desktop is unable to start.

Fallback: if autofill close fails, inspect `QUALITY_GATE_RESULT.json`, fill only the named thin or missing files, and rerun `knowledge_workflow.py close`.
