## Autofill Insights

Observation: Knowledge Workflow evidence can be captured from structured session metadata instead of re-written manually at the end.

Insight: keep the quality gate strict, but move evidence drafting into an explicit autofill step that can be launched as a sidecar command.

Suggestion: record concise command/artifact/risk lists during work, then use `autofill --close` as the final gate adapter.

Project: Red Team Studio
Task: RedTeam AX frontend runtime readiness visibility slice
Agent: codex
Status: ready_for_handoff
Summary: RedTeam AX v2 runtime readiness visibility slice: added read-only /api/redteam/v2/runtime-readiness, RedTeam2 runtime readiness panel, frontend contract sanity, accepted gate 15/15 manifest, and plan/wiki/audit updates.
Next action: When Docker daemon and organization OpenVAS/ZAP endpoints are available, rerun container runtime smoke with --allow-real --require-real and external scanner readiness with --allow-network --require-ready.
Artifacts:
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/archive/runs/redteam-ax-v2-accepted-gates/latest_accepted_gate_manifest.json
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/runtime/redteam_v2_api_router.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/runtime/redteam_v2_models.py
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/soc-frontend-vite-react/soc-frontend/idiomatic-react/src/store/methods/reports.js
- J:/PortableApps/genai/projects/ai-agentic-soc/Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_frontend_runtime_readiness_contract.py
Commands:
- .venv/Scripts/python.exe Red Team Studio/고도화/sanity/redteam_ax_accepted_gate_manifest.py -> exit_code 0, accepted_gate_count 15, passed_gate_count 15, failed_gate_count 0
Risks:
- Goal remains active: Docker daemon real container smoke and organization OpenVAS/ZAP endpoint readiness are still environmental blockers, now visible in API/UI.
